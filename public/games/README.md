# Games Logo Directory

This folder is for storing game logos to be used in the games management system.

## Usage

Place game logo files here with names like:
- `valorant.png`
- `csgo.png`
- `dota2.png`
- `pubg.png`

Then reference them in the Games Admin panel as:
- `/games/valorant.png`
- `/games/csgo.png`
- etc.

## File Format Recommendations

- **Format**: PNG, JPG, or SVG
- **Size**: Keep under 500KB for performance
- **Dimensions**: Square format (1:1) works best
- **Background**: Transparent background (PNG) is ideal

1. Go to `/admin/games`
2. Click "Add New Game"
3. Choose "From Public Folder" for logo source
4. Enter: `/games/valorant.png`
